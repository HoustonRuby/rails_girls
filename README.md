# Rails Girls September 2015

We are very excited to share with you how to build a web application using Ruby on Rails.

We love building websites because we get to be creative, solve problems, and make things.  We hope you experience the same joy of creating today!

Each of us began our journey to becoming web developers differently, but we find that a common thread is curiosity and a thirst for learning.

Today, we will cover:

1. Building a site like twitter
2. Ways to put your personal touch on the site
3. Ways to keep building and learning

** Let's get building! **
