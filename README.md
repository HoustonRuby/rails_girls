# Welcome to Rails Girls!

> **Info**

We are very excited to share with you how to build a web application using Ruby on Rails.

We love building websites because we get to be creative, solve problems, and make things.  We hope to share this joy with you today!

Each of us began our journeys to becoming web developers differently, but we find that a common thread is curiosity and a thirst for learning.

Today, we will cover

1. Building a site like this (screenshot here)
2. Putting the site online
3. Ways to keep building and learning
