## To do more with Rails
This guide was written with inspiration from the following guides.  These are some great next steps or ways to practice what you learned further:

* [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
    * An excellent introductory guide that is structured like our guide, but goes a little deeper.  This makes it the **immediate next step**.
* [Hartl's Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)
    * This book is recomended over and over again, and covers web development as a process, not just making a web application with Rails.  It will take some time to get through, but is well worth the time if you are learning to be a web developer.

Each of those resources also have their own lists of resources that are also awesome.

Other manificient resources for learning Rails and staying up to date include:

* [RailsCast](http://railscasts.com/)
    * This is a collection of screen casts. From the about page: "The screencasts are short and focus on one technique so you can quickly move on to applying it to your own project. The topics target the intermediate Rails developer, but beginners and experts will get something out of it as well."
* [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/)
    * This is a popular podcast about Ruby.  Listening to podcasts is helpful. Even if we don't understand everything that is being said, we can stay up to date, become familiar with some terms, gather questions to ask, and hear about recommended resources.
* [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)
    * Weekly emails with the latest news about Ruby and Rails helps us  keep up to date with the latest tools and resources to check out.

## Other coding things

* [On learning to code online](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1dvhrt/codecademy_vs_code_school_vs_treehouse/)
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

### To code for science, data, and academia

Python and R are essential tools in these fields, because of their constantly expanding toolsets from great contributing communities.

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
    * A highly recommended books aimed at beginners with a solid focus on programming basics.

    * An intro to data anlysis with Python.
* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
    * A great resource for learning some R.

### To code in Javascript

Why is Javascript so popular?  Because it runs on every browser and therefore, everyone's computer, without any setup.  While it might not be as friendly to learn in some ways as Ruby and Rails, if you're coding for the web nowadays, you'd need to know a bit of Javascript.  It's even becoming quite a bit of a thing on the server side with the rise of Node.

* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
    * A great introductory book about the basics of programming with Javascript.  It sets up coding problems with a fun narrative.
* [Learning Javascript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)
    * Design patterns are a great way to think about coding and helps us think about how to organize our thoughts and our code for building things.  This book is a great introduction to design patterns and also how to implement them in Javascript.
* [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/)
    * A really fun and interactive way to learn some Javascript and Node through interactive workshops.
* [JavascriptWeekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) and [NodeWeekly](http://nodeweekly.com/)

## Lists

Teehee, this is a list of lists.

* [List of free programming books](http://resrc.io/list/10/list-of-free-programming-books/#index)
    * Some really great free books on here.  In fact, [reSrc.io](http://resrc.io/) in general is awesome.  It aims to find and tag all free programming learning resources.  Their [list of programming interactive tutorials](http://resrc.io/list/217/programming-interactive-tutorials/) looks like a lot of fun!
* [Listing of Gentooman Library](http://books.gentoomen.org/listing.html)
    * Organized by topics, and covers a lot of things from algorithms, artificial intelligence, to game development, etc.  Probably would be overwhelming to [download](http://books.gentoomen.org/) the whole thing, but this is a good catalog of books to take note of for topics you are interested in.
