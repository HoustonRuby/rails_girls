# How does a website work?

Whenever we type an address like [http://railsgirls.com](http://railsgirls.com) into the browser, we are asking the Internet to send us back a specific website at the matching address.  Each website is actually bunch of files that are saved on a computer somewhere, much like your movies, music or pictures.

In some ways, making a request for a website through our browser is like making an order for a dish through a waiter.  The waiter follows a protocol to let the kitchen know about our order and the browser follows a protocol to let the Internet know about our request.

Our request makes it's way to the computer where the files for the webpage is being stored.  These computers are called *servers* because they have the specific purpose of storing data and "serving" it do us.  While servers don't have a screen, mouse or a keyboard, they are much more powerful than the computer we are using to view this page.

When we log onto more complicated sites like [Facebook](https://facebook.com), we get back a dressed up version of some information, or *data*.  This information is stored in something called the *database*.

Just as the chef gathers ingredients from the refridgerator or the pantry, the server gathers information from the database.  The chef then puts together the cherry pie following a recipe the way a server puts together the webpage following instructions that we give it in code!

But enough about pies, let's dig in =).
