<!-- Some things about how to use the book here and things about the code blocksss -->

These are things that you'll see throughout the book, so we want to take a second to explain them here.

## Discussion blocks

> This kind of styled block means this is a discussion point with your coach and group.

## Code Blocks

<!-- I wonder if we can style these differently... -->

```bash
$ This is how you will see code to type into your commandline.
```
<!-- Will have to show > for PCs -->


```rb
Code in this type of block will be typed into your code editor.
```
