On Twitter, we would see the ['Fail Whale' page](http://www.yiyinglu.com/?portfolio=lifting-a-dreamer-aka-twitter-fail-whale) -- or [used to =(](http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2013/11/25/rip-fail-whale/).  Let's make one of our own, with...Fail Snail.

<!-- WHAT!  THERE IS NO MORE FAIL WHALE?! -->

<!-- Maybe address error handling here by bringing up how twitter has that nice fail whale, and we can do a bare bones version of that as seen here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2385799/how-to-redirect-to-a-404-in-rails? -->
