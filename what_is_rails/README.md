# What is Rails?

As we made more websites that were increasingly complex, patterns began to emerge in the way we organized code.  Certain components became very common and things like Rails emerged.

Rails is a whole bunch of Ruby code that this guy () wrote for other people to use to make new sites.  Rails and other things like it are called *frameworks*. Frameworks help us build web applications faster and better.

Over the years, many people have contributed to the framework and anyone can look at the Ruby code that makes Rails.  This means that the project is "open-sourced" and that you and I can influence and contribute to the framework!
